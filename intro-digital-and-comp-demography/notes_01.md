## Introduction to Digital and Computational Demography

MEASURING AND UNDERSTANDING BIAS IN DIGITAL TRACE DATA:

-   Trends Over Time and Filtering Out Bias

-   Surveys and Non-Representative Samples

-   Calibration and Weighting

### What I learnt

-   How to identify and correct bias in digital trace data using demographic methods.

-   How post-stratification and calibration techniques improve representativeness in non-probabilistic samples.

-   How to interpret trends and apply statistical corrections to digital data sources.

-   How to scrape websites using R (with `{rvest}` and `{httr}`) and access web APIs.

### Readings

-   You are where you E-mail: Using E-mail Data to Estimate International Migration Rates

-   Measuring global migration flows using online data

Zagheni’s work laid the methodological foundation for digital demography. Chia et al. built on that foundation with global coverage, real-time estimation, and policy relevance.
