## Bayesian Demography

-   Bayesian and non-Bayesian Methods

-   Implement Bayesian models for estimating demographic indicators

-   Interpret model outputs and articulate the implications and findings

-   Understand how Bayesian statistics can address estimation problems in various demographic applications

#### Bayesian and Non-Bayesian Methods

| Feature | Non-Bayesian (Frequentist) | Bayesian |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Uncertainty | Confidence intervals | Credible intervals |
| Prior knowledge | Not used | Explicitly included |
| Interpretation | Probability of data given model | Probability of model given data |
| Flexibility | Fixed parameters | Parameters treated as distributions |
| Small data | Often unreliable | Can still produce estimates |

**Gompertz regression model**: statistical model to describe how something grows, decays, or changes over time.

## Bayes' rule

**Formula:**

P(A \| B) = \[ P(B \| A) \* P(A) \] / P(B)

-   P(A \| B): Posterior → probability of event A given evidence B\
-   P(B \| A): Likelihood → probability of evidence B if A is true\
-   P(A): Prior → probability of A before seeing evidence\
-   P(B): Normalizing factor → overall probability of evidence B
