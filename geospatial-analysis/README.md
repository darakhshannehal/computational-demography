## Assessing climate impact on Demographic outcomes

-   **Geospatial data** and its relevance to demography

-   Environmental data sources

-   How to use environmental data in R

**Introduction to Geospatial data**

-   What Are Geospatial Data?

-   Vector vs Raster Data

-   Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

### **Practical Implications**

-   **Temperature & Fertility**: High temperatures linked to reduced fertility (Conte Keivabu et al., 2024)

-   **Temperature & Mortality**: Heatwaves increase mortality risk (Ballester et al., 2023)

-   **Environmental exposures** → affect population statistics → shape vulnerability → inform policy

### **Environmental Data Sources & Spatial Linking**

#### **Open Environmental Data**

-   Climatic data is increasingly accessible via:

    -   Weather stations (in situ)

    -   Satellites (remote sensing)

    -   Modelled datasets (e.g. reanalysis, projections)

-   Combined sources improve historical accuracy and global coverage.

#### **Key Data Sources**

-   Meteorological Data

-   Air Pollution Data

#### **Spatial Linking for Demographic Research**

Connect environmental data to population-relevant locations

**Techniques**:

-   **Vector**: 1:1 joins, distance calculations

-   **Raster**: Buffering, filtering, averaging around points

#### **Example Use Case:**

-   London Congestion Charge Study (Conte Keivabu & Ruttenauer, 2022)

#### AI AND GEOSPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS

-   Do you see some potential in using novel AI methods (e.g., LLMs) in combination with Geospatial data?
-   In which way would you use it in your own work?

#### **Next Step: Geospatial data analysis in R**

-   Assessing climate impact on demographic outcomes.

-   Downloading climate data from ECMWF via API.

-   Retrieve the meteorological data for a city. Visualize the temperature values for that city

-   Demographic/health outcome and a climatic exposure of interest: Types of geospatial data used to analyze the impact on demographic/health outcomes.
